This repository is an attempt to provide resources for *Documentation as Code* and publication in various forms.
The best available frame to enable Documentation as Code is *ASCIIDOC*.

The goal is to keep documentation within project source code, hence allowing ease update of code and doc.

Publication of documentation often requires to follow company-rules, and doc-as-code allows publication of your docs to at least:
- inline git doc
- PDF
- HTML
- Confluence

See link:https://github.com/kalemena/docs-tools/blob/master/src/adoc/00-index.adoc[This project doc] for details on how to achieve this goal.
