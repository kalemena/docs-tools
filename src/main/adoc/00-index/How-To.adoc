This chapter shows how to edit and publish documentation to the various destination mentioned above.

== Pre-Requisits

.Building the few docker image in this repository
[source, bash]
----
$ make build
----

== Editing

Using *Visual Studio Code*, install plugings such as *AsciiDoc* in order to render the *.adoc* files.

Follow syntax as documented in link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual[AsciiDoctor User Manual]

== Mingrammer Diagrams (standalone)

link:https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/docs/guides/diagram[Mingrammer] is tool of choice for architecture diagram as code.
Files are standard python files, easily understandable.

See example at link:{assetsdir}/assets-architecture-hla.py[assets-architecture-hla.py]

[TIP]
====
Building assets is already part of next commands used to publish to PDF or Confluence.
However Mingrammer remains a standalone tool.
====

.Building diagrams with mingrammer tool
[source, bash]
----
# Create python assets under *src/main/adoc/assets* folder (e.g. assets-architecture-hla.py)
$ make publishAssets

# PNG files will be available under *build/adoc/images* folder (e.g. assets-architecture-hla.png)
----

== Publishing

Building and Publishing the documentation can be done with targets:

* Confluence
* HTML
* PDF Book

=== Editing/Publishing to PDF

Obviously, PDF are published in the form of *Books* while Confluence are set of *Pages*.
This make somewhat of a difference, but same doc can however be published to both targets.

.Editing the documentation for publication to PDF
*_SampleProject-Book.adoc* holds the book, which is essentially a structured set of includes from the various *adoc* files used to publish to Confluence.

NOTE: See link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/blob/master/docs/theming-guide.adoc#applying-your-theme[Theming Guide]

.Building the documentation as PDF
[source, bash]
----
$ make publishToPDF
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The published documentation PDF book will be found under *build/_SampleProject-Book.pdf*
====

=== Editing/Publishing to Confluence

This requires a Confluence instance, but thankfully a temporary instance can be started on localhost for testing.

.Confluence start/stop/clean
[source, bash]
----
$ confluence.start    # Wait a bit for this to settle !
$ confluence.logs
$ confluence.stop
$ confluence.clean
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Confluence comes from link:https://github.com/confluence-publisher/confluence-publisher-it[]
This environment has a 3h timeframe license only for testing.

Confluence is available at link:http://localhost:8090[]

The following users are configured:
- admin/admin
- confluence-publisher-it/1234
====

.Editing the documentation as Confluence
This is about editing the multiple *adoc* files starting from *00-Index.adoc*, and recursively the folder with same name, etc
Each Confluence page is matching an *adoc* file, and title is the top first section.
Sub-pages are the recursive folder themselves holding other *adoc* files.

See link:https://github.com/confluence-publisher/confluence-publisher[Confluence Publisher GIT] for details.

.Setting up the target for publication
From current folder, edit the file named *.env-confluence* with your credentials. Don't edit anything else.

[TIP]
====
ANCESTOR_ID is found by browsing Confluence page and clicking Edit button. 
The Ancestor Id is the pageId seen in URL such as http://localhost:8090/pages/viewinfo.action?pageId=327706
====

.Building the documentation as Confluence
[source, bash]
----
$ make publishToConfluence
----

TIP: The Confluence page will be found under the project page defined as *ANCESTOR_ID*.
