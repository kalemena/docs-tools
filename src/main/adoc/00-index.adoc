== Description

Nowadays, projects hosted on GitHub often use a *documentation-as-code*, where documentation is written as text using formatting such as *Markdown* or *Asciidoc*.
*AsciiDoc* is used here because this formatting offers much higher flexibility and features than *Markdown*.
*AsciiDoc* is as simple as *Markdown*, for things that are doable in *Markdown*.

This Cookbook uses *Asciidoctor*, a fast text processor and publishing toolchain for converting AsciiDoc content to HTML5, EPUB3, PDF, DocBook 5

For *Confluence* publishing, *confluence-publisher* allows, through a pre-defined set of folder structure to publish pages one-to-one with Confluence page hierarchical structure.

*PlantUML* is used to produce various diagrams from text, and Mingrammer python language for Architecture or deployment diagrams.

At last, few *if/else* are used (mostly at top of each adoc pages) to allow the documentation to be rendered on multiple targets:

- GitHub
- PDF
- HTML
- Confluence

- Web presentation (HTML with reveal.js)
