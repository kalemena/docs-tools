[NOTE]
====
The documentation is written in the form of AsciiDoc.

_Version of Confluence Publisher : {confluencePublisherVersion}_
====

== Description

Nowadays, projects hosted on GitHub often use a *documentation-as-code*, where documentation is written as text using formatting such as *Markdown* or *Asciidoc*

*AsciiDoc* is used here because this formatting offers much higher flexibility and features.

*Asciidoctor* is a fast text processor and publishing toolchain for converting AsciiDoc content to HTML5, EPUB3, PDF, DocBook 5

== How-To

=== Editing

Using *Visual Studio Code*, install plugings such as AsciiDoc in order to render the *.adoc* files.

Follow syntax as documented in link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual[AsciiDoctor User Manual]

=== Building

Building the documentation can be done with targets:

* Confluence
* HTML
* PDF Book



// ==== Confluence

// From current folder, edit the file named *.env-confluence* with your credentials. Don't edit anything else.

// [TIP]
// ====
// ANCESTOR_ID is found by browsing Confluence page and clicking Edit button. The Ancestor Id is the pageId seen in URL such as http://localhost:8090/pages/viewinfo.action?pageId=327706
// ====

// Then run command from console:

//     $ make publishToConfluence

// The Confluence page will be found under the project page defined as *ANCESTOR_ID* in .env file.

// ==== HTML

// WARNING: FIXME

// FIXME: link:https://darshandsoni.com/asciidoctor-skins/[Theming]

// ==== PDF

// From current folder, run following command:

//     $ make publishToPDF

// The documentation will be rendered under the *build/_pdfbook.pdf* file

// NOTE: See link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/blob/master/docs/theming-guide.adoc#applying-your-theme[Theming Guide]

// == Tips

// Here are few tips: 

// * link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor[Asciidoctor Docker image]
// * link:https://bcouetil.gitlab.io/academy/BP-asciidoc.html[AsciiDoc Tips @ Zenika]

// For example *foldable source* :

// +++ <details open><summary> +++
// *opened by default*
// +++ </summary><div> +++
// [source, json]
// ....
// {
//    "plop" : "key", "value" : "value"
// }
// ....
// +++ </div></details> +++
