[NOTE]
====
The documentation is written in the form of AsciiDoc.

_Version of Confluence Publisher : {confluencePublisherVersion}_
====

== Description

Nowadays, projects hosted on GitHub often use a *documentation-as-code*, where documentation is written as text using formatting such as *Markdown* or *Asciidoc*

*AsciiDoc* is used here because this formatting offers much higher flexibility and features.

*Asciidoctor* is a fast text processor and publishing toolchain for converting AsciiDoc content to HTML5, EPUB3, PDF, DocBook 5

== How-To

=== Editing

Using *Visual Studio Code*, install plugings such as AsciiDoc in order to render the *.adoc* files.

Follow syntax as documented in link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual[AsciiDoctor User Manual]

=== Building

Building the documentation can be done with targets:

* Confluence
* HTML
* PDF Book



==== Confluence

From current folder, edit the file named *.env-confluence* with your credentials. Don't edit anything else.

[TIP]
====
ANCESTOR_ID is found by browsing Confluence page and clicking Edit button. The Ancestor Id is the pageId seen in URL such as https://intranet.genesys.com/pages/editpage.action?pageId=127375463
====

Then run command from console:

    $ make publishToConfluence

The Confluence page will be found under the project page defined as *ANCESTOR_ID* in .env file.

==== HTML

WARNING: FIXME

FIXME: link:https://darshandsoni.com/asciidoctor-skins/[Theming]

==== PDF

From current folder, run following command:

    $ make publishToPDF

The documentation will be rendered under the *build/_pdfbook.pdf* file

NOTE: See link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/blob/master/docs/theming-guide.adoc#applying-your-theme[Theming Guide]

== Tips

Here are few tips: 

* link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor[Asciidoctor Docker image]
* link:https://bcouetil.gitlab.io/academy/BP-asciidoc.html[AsciiDoc Tips @ Zenika]

For example *foldable source* :

+++ <details open><summary> +++
*opened by default*
+++ </summary><div> +++
[source, json]
....
{
   "plop" : "key", "value" : "value"
}
....
+++ </div></details> +++

== Examples

Examples of *Doc As Code* source repository and rendering below.

Not all are using *AsciiDoc*, however the principle remains the same with text source getting processed and rendered to different targets:

* Microsoft docs with 2000 repos (with per language repo): link:https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs[Microsoft Docs repos in GIT]
** One of the doc source and rendered:
*** link:https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/bot-docs.fr-fr[Microsoft Doc sample in GIT]
*** link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0[Microsoft Doc sample Azure Bot]

* Docker
** link:https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io[Docker Docs in GIT]
** link:https://docs.docker.com/[Docker Docs rendered]

* Amazon user guides:
** link:https://github.com/awsdocs[Amazon Docs in GIT]
