= Attachments

If an AsciiDoc file references a non-AsciiDoc file (e.g. a text file, PDF, ...) that non-AsciiDoc file is automatically
added as an attachment to the corresponding Confluence page. Referenced non-AsciiDoc files are resolved relative to the
location of the referencing AsciiDoc file.

Attachment links may specify a label.

[listing]
....
link:../files/attachment.txt[Attachment]
....

link:../files/attachment.txt[Attachment]


If no label is specified, the attachment filename is used as the label.

[listing]
....
link:../files/attachment.txt[]
....

link:../files/attachment.txt[]
